        New startup company would like to create flight and hotel booking system website. This website should help
        user to book the flight and hotel. They ask you to create a website with separate architecture, server and
        client side. They’re planning to create a mobile version later, so they’re asking you to build this website with
        the web service architecture.
        Development phase will be separate into two phase. First phase is creating backend web service and the
        second phase is to create front end website. The server should serve API only. There should be no any visual
        interface output. The only interface is the Application Programming Interface (API).
        DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND TASKS
        The description for this module will be listed below. Your first task is to create a restful web service API that
        could be used by the front end to communicate the data.
        The server takes application/json request. Response should also be in JSON format. All response should
        follows with a correct status code—Success, Not Found and Bad Request. No authentication is required for
        all the API calls.
        Data Type

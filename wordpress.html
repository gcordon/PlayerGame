        running this event needs help in designing a new and vibrant website in order to market the event and sell
        tickets.
        DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AND TASKS
        This module involves knowledge about website design, website layout techniques, client side scripting, and
        server side scripting, all combined in one CMS project. The CMS used for this module is the most common
        global CMS: WordPress.
        DESIGN
        Competitors will design a responsive landing page for the music event ‘EventX’. The website will be
        developed as a WordPress child-theme for the Blankslate theme. The child-theme will be
        supplemented with a number of plugins.
        The company has prepared content and has requested you to implement the provided layout. Your
        tasks are to design the logo, style guide and website.

        2 of 5TECHNIQUE
        The website layout should be developed with the ability to add menu items and content without
        damaging the design. In the future some widgets will be placed in the sidebar. Make sure this
        sidebar can easily be activated or deactivated without damaging the design.
        The layout of the website needs to be identical to the provided wireframes, but also needs to
        respond when scaling the browser window between smartphone portrait size and widescreen size.
        Make use of HTML and CSS by the W3C standards for good SEO support.
        Clicking at post items may not cause a page refresh, but post content will be loaded asynchronous
        from the server.
        The company wants you to use the JQuery image slider they paid for a year ago. You need to
        rebuild the slider to a proper WordPress plugin.
        CONFIGURATION
        For safety reasons two user profiles needs to be created:
        • The Admin user - access to the complete WordPress dashboard.
        • Username: adMinX
        • Password: Never4get
        • The Client user - access to the WordPress dashboard except the Appearance, Plugins, Users and Tools.
        • Username: uSure
        • Password: Never4get2
        The provided plugins should be used to make the website SEO friendly, handle website security
        and to analyze the visitors of the website.
        WEBSITE STRUCTURE
        The website consists of the several sections described below.
        Featured section
        The Featured section contains a headline, sub headline and an interactive image slider with
        images of the booked artists. When hovering an image, an mp3 track of the corresponding artist is
        played. The track is paused when the mouse leaves the image.
        For the image slider you need to use the delivered JQuery slider.
        The header section should have an energetic appearance, appropriate to the event.
        The client wants to have the ability to add, remove or change the images and mp3 files of the slider
        using the WordPress dashboard.
        News section
        The News section contains news items about the event. The News section should have a readable
        and clean design. The client does not have news items; you can use placeholder text to show at
        least 3 news items.
        Each news item contains title, date, shortened content and a ‘read more’ button. By clicking the
        button the full content will be loaded from the server, without a page refresh (asynchronous).

        This section should be designed attractive and with a clear call to action.

        button using the WordPress dashboard.
        Sidebar section
        The sidebar section will be used to show the sponsors of the event and there should be space to
        add some widgets.

        sponsors and website widgets using the WordPress dashboard.
        Footer section
